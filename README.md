# Codecademy JavaScript Syntax Portfolio Project - Mixed Messages

This very small and straightforward project is an exercise offered along
[Codecademy's Full-Stack Engineer Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path).

The objective was to make a command-line JavaScript tool which would generate messages
built from three components, each picked at random from a list.

## Theme

I decided to keep things simple and encouraging and made a very simple generator of motivational messages.

The basic template of a message is "*#Time*, you should try to *#Verb* *#Object*".

For instance, the generator could advise "Today, you should try to feel grateful about your relationships".

![Mind map representing the concept](https://github.com/NadCAtarun/mixed-messages/blob/c89452a64f8700140a506e453f68b1b8c6b5811c/concept.png?raw=true "Concept (as a mind map)")

## How to use

The script has no dependencies but obviously does require [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to run:

`node motivate.js`
